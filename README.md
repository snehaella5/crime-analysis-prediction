# Crime Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing crime data to identify patterns and predict potential crime trends. The objective is to support data-driven decision-making using exploratory analysis, forecasting, and clustering techniques.

## Overview

With the growing availability of crime-related datasets, it becomes possible to apply analytical and machine learning techniques to gain insights from past events and anticipate future patterns. This project includes:

- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Time series forecasting of crime trends
- Crime classification using statistical models
- Unsupervised clustering to group similar crime behaviors
- Final summarized insights and presentation

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Parsing dates and timestamps
- Renaming and restructuring columns for analysis

### 2. Visualization
- Monthly and yearly crime trends
- Crime distribution by type or region
- Heatmaps and correlation matrices

### 3. Time Series Forecasting
- Forecasting crime trends using ARIMA or similar models
- Analysis of seasonality and trend components

### 4. Crime Classification
- Applying classification models on structured features
- Interpreting model performance and accuracy

### 5. Clustering
- Unsupervised grouping of crime incidents
- K-Means or other clustering techniques used to identify similar patterns

### 6. Crime Mapping
- Geospatial insights (if coordinates or regions are present)
- Mapping high-risk zones or dense crime areas 

## Technologies and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
